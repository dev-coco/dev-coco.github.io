<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>"Image Upload to Cloud" is a Google Apps Script application (hereinafter referred to as "the Application"), designed to help users manage image data within Google Sheets. This Application is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently in compliance with Google API Services User Data Policy.</p>

<p><strong>2. Google User Data Access</strong></p>
<p>The Application may request access to the following Google services and data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Doc:</strong> A Google Doc will be temporarily created and images will be written into it for OCR function, which will be automatically deleted after use.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Sheets:</strong> Read and write access to spreadsheets you select. Specifically, the Application reads image URLs from certain cells and writes OCR and translation results into specific cells. No other spreadsheets or cells are accessed.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Drive:</strong> Create, read, and write files in a folder named "Stored Images". The Application does not access or modify any other files in your Google Drive.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Drive OCR:</strong> Temporary processing of image files to extract text via Google’s built-in OCR functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Translate (LanguageApp):</strong> Translate OCR results. Text is only sent to Google’s translation API for processing and is not stored by the Application.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Data Sharing & Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>The Application does <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or disclose your Google user data to any third parties. All data stays within your Google account and Google services.</p>

<p><strong>4. Data Security & Sensitive Data Protection</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All operations occur within Google’s secure cloud environment (Google Sheets, Google Drive, Language services).</li>
  <li>No data is transmitted to external servers or stored outside your Google account.</li>
  <li>The Application only requests the minimum necessary permissions (principle of least privilege).</li>
  <li>Any temporary processing (e.g., OCR, translation) occurs through Google APIs with encrypted communication.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Data Retention & Deletion</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong> The Application itself does not retain any Google user data. Files and results remain only in your Google Drive and Google Sheets.</li>
  <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You may delete any created files or folders ("Stored Images") at any time from your Google Drive.</li>
  <li><strong>Revoking Access:</strong> You can revoke the Application’s access to your Google account at any time through <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google Account Permissions</a>.</li>
